# CRes

CRes (Crater Resonance) is a one-dimensional (1D) numerical method for solving the linear acoustic wave equation within a volcanic crater. For a specified crater geometry and excitation source at the base of the crater, CRes computes the velocity and pressure at the crater outlet and can propagate the signal to an infrasound receiver some distance from the outlet. The linear acoustic wave equation is written in terms of two first-order differential equations for pressure and acoustic flow and is solved by CRes using a finite-difference frequency-domain method. CRes is written in MATLAB  and runs efficiently on a standard desktop/laptop computer.
